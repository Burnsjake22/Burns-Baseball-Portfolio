## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
avg_velocity_by_year <- D %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_fastball_velocity = mean(fastball_avg_speed, na.rm = TRUE))

# View the result
print(avg_velocity_by_year)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(avg_velocity_by_year, aes(x = year, y = avg_fastball_velocity)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Average Fastball Velocity by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average Fastball Velocity (mph)") +
  theme_minimal()
```



```{r}
strikeouts_by_year <- D %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(total_strikeouts = sum(strikeout, na.rm = TRUE))

print(strikeouts_by_year)
```
```{r}
ggplot(strikeouts_by_year, aes(x = year, y = total_strikeouts)) +
  geom_line(color = "purple") +
  geom_point(color = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Total Strikeouts by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Strikeouts") +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
Kpercent_by_year <- D %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_k_percent = mean(k_percent, na.rm = TRUE))

print(Kpercent_by_year)
```
```{r}
avg_exit_velocity <- D %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_exit_vel = mean(exit_velocity_avg, na.rm = TRUE))

print(avg_exit_velocity)
```
```{r}
avg_spin_fastball <- D %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_fastball_spin = mean(fastball_avg_spin, na.rm = TRUE))

print(avg_spin_fastball)
```
```{r}
home_run_by_year <- D %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(total_hr = sum(home_run, na.rm = TRUE))

print(home_run_by_year)
```
